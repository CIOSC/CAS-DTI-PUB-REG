# Selection of Objects of Conformity

Objects of conformity are used to select and specify the requirements to be assessed.

Objects of conformity assessment consist one or several of the following:

## Define Context
In delivering a program or service, an organization operates within a certain environment or set of circumstances known as the context. Context may be further defined by factors such as mandate, target population (clients) and responsibilities prescribed by legislation or agreements.

Understanding and defining context assists organizations in determining requirements. For example, what information is required, and what information is not required. It also helps determine commonalities with other organizations or jurisdictions, and whether information or assurance processes can be used across contexts.

It is recommended that organizations consider the follwing when defining or specifying the context of a given program or service:

* Intended recipient of a service. Recipients may be external to the federal government (for example, citizens, businesses, non-Canadians, non-profit organizations), or internal to the federal government (for example, departments);
* Size, characteristics and composition of the client population;
* Commonalities with other services across organizationa;
* Organizations with similar mandates; and
* Use of common infrastructure or shared services.

For a regulated service, specify the applicable legislation and regulation. For example, in Canada the [Know Your Client Requirements of Persons and Entities](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/client-clientele/Guide11/11-eng)

*Assesor Tip: Develop a well-defined context statement (one or two sentences or at most, a concise paragraph) that provides a clear understanding of the situational aspect of the program or service.*

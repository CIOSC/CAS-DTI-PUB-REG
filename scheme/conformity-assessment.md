# What is conformity assessment?

Conformity assessment is the demonstration that what is being supplied actually meets the requirements specified or claimed. Conformity assessment can be applied to a product (which, for these purposes includes a service), a process, a management system, a body or persons and includes activities such as testing, inspection and certification.

Conformity can be:
* assessed by a body that is independent of any party interested in the outcome of the assessment (third party conformity assessment); or
* assessed by any party that is interested in the outcome of the assessment.

This document focuses on the application of third-party conformity assessment given that it is an open market activity and the government therefore has a more active interest in it than in first- or second-party conformity assessment. This should not however be taken to indicate a preference for third party conformity assessment and some of the principles set out may equally apply to first- and second-party conformity assessment.

Accreditation is also conformity assessment but as it is used to evaluate third party conformity assessors, it functions better as part of the framework for the conformity assessment market rather than within it. In this paper therefore accreditation is considered separately from other forms of conformity assessment.

A conformity assessment scheme (‘scheme’) is used to demonstrate that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person, or body are fulfilled. Schemes can range from being voluntary, self-regulated for commercial marketing purposes, to mandatory schemes owned by certification bodies who are accredited, carried out by authorized independent assessors, and subject to normative and informative documents, such as national standards, related policies, and guidelines.

# Benefits of conformity assessment

Demonstrating compliance with standards and other criteria assumes greater importance to consumer confidence as products and services etc. become increasingly technically complex. Conformity assessment is thus an indispensable part of a national, business, technology and quality infrastructure. When applied correctly, conformity assessment can:
* provide purchasers with confidence in the suppliers, products or services they use.
* help businesses be competitive;
* facilitate trade;
* create market advantage; and
* provide a visible link between standards and the market.

If applied incorrectly however, conformity assessment can also:
* be a burden on business;
* create barriers to trade;
* inhibit innovation; and
* confuse the market.

## Conformity Assessment principles

Conformity assessment principles are as follows:
* Conformity assessment schemes should be driven by market demand (including demand from end-users and consumers) or, where justified by the public interest, by regulators rather than by those with a commercial interest in conformity assessment.
*Except where the government has specialist regulatory expertise and responsibilities, or where justified by legitimate end-user/consumer concerns, conformity assessment should be a free-market, competitive activity.
* Where conformity assessment depends on the measurement of the parameters of performance of a product or process, measurements or test results should be traceable to national or international measurement standards.
* Where conformity assessment is required in support of regulation, the infrastructure developed for non-regulatory conformity assessment should be used as far as is possible.
* Conformity assessment should be conducted to recognised standards, preferably national and/or international standards, or other transparent and objective criteria, such as technical regulations, in a non-discriminatory manner.

Conformity assessment schemes and any associated marks should be developed and used so that they facilitate, not discourage, innovation and trade; and/or should be developed and used so that they protect public interest and legitimate end-user concerns (e.g. safety). Conformity assessment schemes should be developed in accordance with national policy and international standards, for conformity assessment schemes.

Conformity assessment procedures that impose the lightest burden on business, commensurate with the objective to be achieved (e.g. regulatory confidence or product/workplace safety) should be preferred over other more onerous procedures.
Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) should demonstrate competence by seeking accreditation against the relevant national (Standard Council of Canada) and international standards, in particular the ISO 2 /IEC 3 normative documents.
Application of conformity assessment principles

In applying these principles:
* supports national measurement infrastructure for conformity assessment and, through mutual recognition agreements, equivalence with measurement standards in other countries;
* recommends the use of the national and international standards infrastructure for the development of standards and other criteria for conformity assessment and participates in the standards development process where appropriate; and
promotes the use of accredited conformity assessment bodies, as a means of improving competitiveness and facilitating trade.

# Accreditation
## What is accreditation?

It is important that the market has assurance that conformity assessment bodies (CABs) themselves operate to acceptable standards and this is the purpose of accreditation. The accreditation process determines, in the public interest, the technical competence and integrity of organisations such as those offering testing, calibration and certification services (commonly referred to as conformity assessment).
Benefits of accreditation

Accreditation operates across all market sectors and provides an impartial assessment against nationally and internationally recognised standards. This has benefits for several groups.

**Government**

Accreditation provides confidence in the competence and consistency of conformity assessment activities that can be used to support the implementation of government policies and regulations that impact on health, welfare, security and the environment.

**Industry**

Accredited conformity assessment is essential for decision-making and risk management. Organisations can save time and money by selecting accredited and therefore competent conformity assessment services.
Accredited conformity assessment can provide a competitive advantage and facilitates access to export markets – with the aim of ‘tested or certified once, accepted everywhere.’
Accurate measurements and tests carried out in compliance with best practice have the potential to limit product failure, control manufacturing costs and foster innovation.

**Accredited organizations**

Accreditation provides objective evidence that conformity assessment organisations conform with recognised standards. It is the internationally recognised system that is used to develop and sustain high standards of performance.

**Consumers**
Accredited conformity assessment gives consumers confidence through ensuring consistently high standards in the quality of products or services purchased.

### Accreditation policy principles
The principles are as follows:
* Accreditation is applicable to both the regulated and non-regulated sectors.
* Accreditation being at the topmost level of control should provide an authoritative statement of the technical competence of CABs.
* Accreditation is considered to be a public authority activity and should therefore operate in the public interest. It should be self-supporting but run as a not for profit activity.
* Accreditation should be operated with integrity; independent of the organisations it accredits and impartial, and free from commercial pressure. The CAB shall operate to recognised standards or other transparent criteria and be compliant with applicabletechnical requirements, demonstrated, where appropriate, through peer evaluation.

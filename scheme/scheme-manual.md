All exclusions must be reflected in assessment and resulting certification.

## 5 Audit Approach

### Audit Engagement
The lead auditor should:
* communicate the relevant parts of the assessment engagement, including the risks and opportunities
* define objectives, scope and criteria, for each asssessment
* agree on audit methods


### Objects of Conformity

[Objects of conformity](./objects-of-conformity.md) are used to select and specify the requirements to be assessed.


### Assessment Time Determination

In determining the audit time (duration and/or effort), among other things, the following aspects are considered before proceeding: 

* the requirements of the relevant management system standard; 
* complexity of the client and its management system; 
* technological and regulatory context; 
* any outsourcing of any activities included in the scope of the management system; 
* the results of any prior audits; 
* size and number of sites, their geographical locations and multi-site considerations; 
* the risks associated with the products, processes or activities of the organization; 
* whether audits are combined, joint or integrated. 

**Assessment duration** estimate is based on an agreed timeline with the client. Duration estimates should consider factors, such as:
* Client schedule availablity and constraints
* Resource avaialability and contstraints
* Risks
* ...

**Assessment effort** estimate is based on full-time-equivaltants (FTEs). Assessment effort should consider factors, such as:
* Scope of assessment
* Degree of assesment
* Risks

**Factors which may increase assessment duration and effort**
* Logistics that may involving more than one geographical location where efforts are carried out.
* Multiple languages requiring interpreters or preventing individual auditors from working independently

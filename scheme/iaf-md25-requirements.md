Prepared in accordance with [IAF MD25:2022](https://iaf.nu/iaf_system/uploads/documents/IAF_MD_25_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_CAS_07012022.pdf) 

## **Criteria for Evalution of Conformity Assessment Schemes**

This document contains minimum requirements for conformity assessment schemes (CAS) when evaluating national, regional or international CAS to demonstrate that they meet requirements specified in ISO/IEC 17011, Clause 4.6.3.

## Definitions
The following definitions (slightly edited) are provided to assist the reader in the document. Please refer to [IAF MD25:2022](https://iaf.nu/iaf_system/uploads/documents/IAF_MD_25_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_CAS_07012022.pdf) for the normative definitions

* **Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS)** Set of rules and procedures that describes the object of conformity assessment, identifies the specified requirements and provides the methodology for performing conformity assessment (Source ISO/IEC 17000).
* **Scheme Owner (SO)** Organization(s) responsible for developing and maintaining a CAS. 
* **SO Authorization of a CAB** SO authorization means that the SO accepts certificates, reports, statements or attestations issued by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) for the purposes of confirming that the object of the conformity assessment meets the requirements of its CAS.
* **Scheme Specific Requirements for CABs** The specific requirements for the CAB prescribed by the SO for operating under its CAS, in addition to the AB’s rules and the applicable IAF Level 3, International Standard. [IAF PR4](https://iaf.nu/en/iaf-documents/?cat_id=8)
* **Scheme Specific Requirements for ABs** The specific requirements for the ABs prescribed by the SO for undertaking accreditation activity related to the CAS in addition to, but not excluding, any IAF/Region’s rules nor ISO/IEC 17011 requirements. 
* **Regulators** Governmental entities implementing legislation.

## 3. Requirements for Scheme Owners
## General ABs shall ensure that the following conditions are met before cooperating with an SO,unless any of the conditions are not applicable to a specific CAS.


## 3.1 Sufficient evidence and justification that the conformity assessment activity and the standard selected for the accreditation of the CABs is appropriate shall be maintained.
* The conformity assessment sheme is based on prior led the the Canadian Public Sector to assess pubic sector programs to ensure that they have the integrity to accepted as a trusted digital identity provider. The repo is found here: [Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framemwork](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP). The conformity assessment scheme is being expanded in scope to include regulated services, such as banking, insurance, and health.
* The selected standard is CAN/CIOSC 103-1 Digital Trust and Identity ...

## 3.2 The SO shall make a general description of the CAS publicly available without request. The scheme documents, including the criteria and process to be used in assessing conformity shall be publicly available. 
* The conformity assessment scheme is publicly avaiable in this repo. Please review [README.md](../README.md)

## 3.3 The SO should demonstrate that the CAS has been validated. 
<i>The validation should be documented and include the following aspects:
* i) A description of the purpose of the CAS; 
* ii) A description of the requirements of the CAS; 
* iii) An analysis of the appropriateness of the established requirements for fulfilling the defined purpose of the CAS; 
* iv) A description of the methods to be used for determining fulfilment of the requirements; 
* v) An analysis showing that the described methods to be used for determining fulfilment of the requirements are appropriate; 
* vi) The decision on the conformity assessment activity to be used (including identification of the applicable conformity assessment standard); and 
* vii) An analysis showing that the selected conformity assessment activity is appropriate. </i>

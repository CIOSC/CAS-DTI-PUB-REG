## **Criteria for Evalution of Conformity Assessment Schemes**

This document contains minimum requirements for conformity assessment schemes (CAS) when evaluating national, regional or international CAS to demonstrate that they meet requirements specified in ISO/IEC 17011, Clause 4.6.3.

## Definitions
The following definitions (slightly edited) are provided to assist the reader in the document. Please refer to [IAF MD25:2022](https://iaf.nu/iaf_system/uploads/documents/IAF_MD_25_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_CAS_07012022.pdf) for the normative definitions

* **Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS)** Set of rules and procedures that describes the object of conformity assessment, identifies the specified requirements and provides the methodology for performing conformity assessment (Source ISO/IEC 17000).
* **Scheme Owner (SO)** Organization(s) responsible for developing and maintaining a CAS. 
* **SO Authorization of a CAB** SO authorization means that the SO accepts certificates, reports, statements or attestations issued by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) for the purposes of confirming that the object of the conformity assessment meets the requirements of its CAS.
* **Scheme Specific Requirements for CABs** The specific requirements for the CAB prescribed by the SO for operating under its CAS, in addition to the AB’s rules and the applicable IAF Level 3, International Standard. [IAF PR4](https://iaf.nu/en/iaf-documents/?cat_id=8)
* **Scheme Specific Requirements for ABs** The specific requirements for the ABs prescribed by the SO for undertaking accreditation activity related to the CAS in addition to, but not excluding, any IAF/Region’s rules nor ISO/IEC 17011 requirements. 
* **Regulators** Governmental entities implementing legislation.

## 3. Requirements for Scheme Owners
## General ABs shall ensure that the following conditions are met before cooperating with an SO,unless any of the conditions are not applicable to a specific CAS.


### 3.1 Sufficient evidence and justification that the conformity assessment activity and the standard selected for the accreditation of the CABs is appropriate shall be maintained.

* The conformity assessment sheme is based on prior work led the the Canadian Public Sector to assess pubic sector programs to ensure that they have the integrity to accepted as a trusted digital identity provider. The repo is found here: [Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP). The conformity assessment scheme is being expanded in scope to include regulated services, such as banking, insurance, and health.
* The selected standard is CAN/CIOSC 103-1 Digital Trust and Identity ...

***

### 3.2 The SO shall make a general description of the CAS publicly available without request. The scheme documents, including the criteria and process to be used in assessing conformity shall be publicly available. 

***
* The conformity assessment scheme is publicly avaiable in this repo. Please review [README.md](../README.md)
***

### 3.3 The SO should demonstrate that the CAS has been validated. 
<i>The validation should be documented and include the following aspects:
* i) A description of the purpose of the CAS; 
* ii) A description of the requirements of the CAS; 
* iii) An analysis of the appropriateness of the established requirements for fulfilling the defined purpose of the CAS; 
* iv) A description of the methods to be used for determining fulfilment of the requirements; 
* v) An analysis showing that the described methods to be used for determining fulfilment of the requirements are appropriate; 
* vi) The decision on the conformity assessment activity to be used (including identification of the applicable conformity assessment standard); and 
* vii) An analysis showing that the selected conformity assessment activity is appropriate. </i>

***

* Detailed information is provided in [Scheme Validation](scheme-validation.md)

***

### 3.4 In case the SO provides any clarification on the CAS to any interested party, this information shall also be available to the ABs and CABs within the CAS 

All clarifications to the Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS), can be registered as an issue with a clarification tag and available immediately on this Github repo. Example [here](https://github.com/CIOSC/CAS-TDI-Public/issues/3). Clarifications are resolved through the same process as other issues.

### 3.5 The SO shall have a legally enforceable agreement with ABs and/or CABs
<i>The SO shall have a legally enforceable agreement with ABs and/or CABs it authorizes which, as a minimum, shall ensure that the CABs use the CAS as published by the SO, without any additions or reductions, and comply with SO rules for applying the symbol/statement/mark, as applicable.</i>

* CIO Strategy Council is the Scheme Owner (SO)
***

### 3.6 The SO shall have a procedure for dealing with complaints relating to the CAS

### 3.10 The SO should monitor the development and review of the standards and other normative documents, 
<i>The SO should monitor the development and review of the standards and other normative documents, whether its own or external, which define the specified requirements used in the scheme. Where changes in the normative documents of the CAS occur, the SO should have a process for making the necessary changes in the CAS, and for managing the implementation of the changes (e.g. transition period) by the Conformity Assessment Bodies’ clients and, where necessary, other parties interested in the CAS.</i>

## 4 Requirememts for a Conformity Assessment Scheme

### 4.1 The CAS should cover the following elements:
<i>The CAS should cover the following elements:
* i)Selection of the object(s) of conformity assessment, including selecting specified requirements to be assessed and planning information collection and sampling activities; 
* ii) Determination, including the use of one or more determination methods (e.g. test, audit and/or examination) to develop complete information regarding fulfilment of the specified requirements by the object of conformity assessment or its sample;
* iii)Review, decision and attestation, including the review of evidence from the determination stage. Conclusion based on the results of the review as to whether fulfilment of specified requirements has been demonstrated and a subsequent attestation that the object of conformity assessment has been reliably demonstrated to fulfil the specified requirements, and any subsequent marking or licensing and their related controls, where applicable;and 
* iv)Surveillance and recertification, as applicable, systematic iteration of conformity assessment activities as a basis for maintaining the validity of the statement of conformity. </i>

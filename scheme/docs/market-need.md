# The Market Need for Digital Trust and Identity Conformity Assessment Scheme

## Introduction
A digital trust and identity program requires more than a robust technical implementation. It requires: 
* accepted principles;
* good governance; 
* specific purpose
* sound management; and most importantly,
* legal context.

There is an emerging market need for the certification of digital trust and identity programs (public sector and regulated services) where the user has confidence in the technology *and* the overall integrity of a program delivering the digital trust service. While digital identity is the initial focus, digital trust, more broadly,encompasses other related and complementary areas, such as: digital credentials, data governance and responsible AI.

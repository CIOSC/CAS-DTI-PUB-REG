# Validation of Need for a Digital Trust and Identity Conformity Assessment Scheme

## Market Need

There is an emerging market need for the certification of digital trust and identity programs for public sector, private sector and Regulated Programs). The market need is beyond whether the technology actually works, but rather that user has confidence in the technology *and* the overall integrity of a program delivering the digital trust service. 

While **digital identity** is the initial focus of this scheme, there is an opportuntiy to expand the scope more broadly to **digital trust** encompassing other areas digital credentials, data governance and responsible AI.
In the end, a digital trust and identity program requires more than a sound technical implementation, it requires: 
* accepted principles;
* good governance; 
* a specific mandate or purpose;
* sound management; 
* a legal operating context; and most importantly,
* user confidence and social acceptance.

## Strategic Fit
The diagram below illustrates the [strategic fit](https://www.bstrategyinsights.com/strategic-fit/) of the conformity assessment scheme (in green) in relation to [ISO 17021-1:2015](https://www.iso.org/standard/61651.html), [ISO/IEC17065:2012](https://www.iso.org/standard/46568.html) and the [Trust Over IP Model](https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/). 

Put simply, the **Digital Trust and Identity Conformity Assessment Scheme**, in accordance with **ISO 17021**, ensures confidence the management system underpinning a digital trust service that provides identity. In turn, conformity assessment schemes for products,processes and services, in accordance with, **ISO 17065**, ensure the confidence of products, processes and services. As depicted in the diagram, there can be overlap of scope beween these schemes, which can be complementary. For example a service that is certified specifically under ISO 17065, may also be part of a larger program that is certified under ISO 17021. 

It is anticipated that market will consist of [competent authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_authority) seeking certification of their programs under 17021. Examples could include:

* **Government digital identity programs** to provide an independent assurance to policymakers, regulators that the program is indeed doing what it is actually intended to do.

* **Industry bodies** seeking mututal recognition across different sectors that work together. The conformity assessment scheme and the resulting certifications provide the independed audit and baseline of confidence required by all industry sectors..

 Vendors of products, processs and services vendors would seek certification under 17065. The schemes (as indicated in the diagram) are complementary to one another, and in certain cases, may overlap in scope. Examples include:

 * **Certification of Products** such as hardware devices that are used for secure authentication or facilitate the collection of sensitve personal data such as biometric templates.

 * **Certification of Processes and Services** such as real-time document checking, digital credential issuance, and liveness testing.

# Description and Purpose of Scheme

Decribed in [README.md](../README.md)

# Description of Requirements

* The scheme requirements are based on the draft of [CAN/CIOSC 103-1 Second Edition](../docs/DRAFT-CAN-CIOSC-103-1-20XX_D1_EN.pdf) which is currently under public review
* Conformance requirements are tabulated and cross-refrenced to the standard in the [worksheet](./tools/Conformity-Assessment-Workbook.xlsx)



# Analyis of Scheme Requirements

* Scheme requirments are based on the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework [Consolidated Overview Version 1.4](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf)

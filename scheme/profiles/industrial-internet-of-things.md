# CAN/CIOSC 105:2022  Cybersecurity of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Devices

## Scope

IIoT devices include a broad range of smart devices – such as sensors, controllers, and edge computers – that are important components of critical infrastructure. Considering the nature of their connectivity, IIoT devices have specific cybersecurity risks not in traditional industrial control system or other IoT applications.

The standard specifies cybersecurity controls for the design and operation of IIoT devices to meet requirements for security, safety, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The standard is intended for organizations planning to acquire new IIoT devices or equipment embedding IIoT devices. It provides a consolidated overview of key security features and practices to meet industry-recommended standards and best practices.

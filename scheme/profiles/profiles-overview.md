# Scheme Profiles Overview

Over time, we envision the **Digital Trust and Identity Conformity Assessment Scheme** will evolve into a more generalized **Digital Trust Conformity Assessment Scheme**, however we are not there yet. Rather than be declarative with this appproach, we are choosing to be empirical, working on a hypothesis, and as knowledge and lessons-learned result from pilot engagements, we will gradually refactor this repo to reflect a more generalized scheme that reflect requirements around digital trust.

The first candididate, of course, is a [Digital Identity Profile](./digital-identity-profile.md) and a placeholder profile has been started.

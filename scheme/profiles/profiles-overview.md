# Scheme Profiles Overview

This scheme is now evolving into a more generalized Digital Trust Conformity Assessment Scheme with profiles. Over time, the scheme will be augmented with profiles to be applied against the full set of national standards.

## Profiles in development

Profiles currently being developed through pilot engagements.

|Digital Trust Profile|Applicable CIOSC Standards|
|---|---|
|[Trusted Digital Identity](./digital-identity-profile.md)|103-1|
|[Data Governance](data-governance-profile.md)|100-1, 100-4|
|[Open Finance](./open-finance.md)|110-1|

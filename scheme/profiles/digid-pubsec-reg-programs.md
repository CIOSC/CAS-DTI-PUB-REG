* may be be applied in other contexts (international, domestic, etc.)

The services may include, but are not limited to: government sign-in services, online benefits delivery, or licensing and permits. Examples of trusted digital identity services used in this context are the [BC Services Card](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card) and [MyAlberta DigitalID](https://account.alberta.ca/) programs.

* The sub-scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be further **restricted** to assess a specialized service or program in relation to assessing a the provision of attributes related **trusted digital identity** only,or

* The sub-scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be **broadened** to assesss a service or program in relation to assess the provision of additional attributes, required for the purposes of **eligibility** (beyond the strict defintion of *trusted digital identity*). Examples of additional attributes may include, *citizenship*, *residential* *address*, *health* *status*, *income* *level*, *professional* *qualifications*, etc.

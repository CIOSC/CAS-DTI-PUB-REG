# Standards and Certification Primer
This document is intended to provide background information for those unfamilar with the standards development and certification process. 
## Accreditation Process
It all begins with the **accreditation process**. There are two types of accreditation: **standards development** for national standards and **certification body** for conformity assessment and certification. In Canada, this is overseen by [Standards Council of Canada](https://scc/ca).  CIOSC is currently an [Accredited Standards Development Organization](https://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2019/cio-strategy-council-earns-accreditation-develop-national-standards-canada) and is currently underway to become  an [Accredited Certification Body](https://www.scc.ca/en/accreditation/find-accredited-or-certified-body).

The diagram below shows how the major pieces fit together conceptually.

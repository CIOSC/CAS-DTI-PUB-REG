# CIO Strategy Council Impartiality Policy
CIO Strategy Council is the legal entity responsible for certification activities; reference to CIO Strategy Council in this Policy and Public Statement refers to this legal entity. 

CIO Strategy Council, its Directors, Staff and Subcontractors fully understand the importance of impartiality and commits to remain impartial in undertaking certification activities. CIO Strategy Council ensures all employees and other personnel involved in certification activities are, and will remain, impartial. To ensure that impartiality is both maintained and can be demonstrated, the following principles have been established: 

 
* CIO Strategy Council certificates are only issued following a review by an independent authorised and competent member of the management team (who has not been involved in the audit) to ensure that no interest shall predominate. 
 
* CIO Strategy Council does not offer management system consultancy or any other form of consultancy to companies or individuals.  

* CIO Strategy Council does not offer an internal audit service to its certified clients. 
 
* CIO Strategy Council does not own or have any interest (financial or otherwise) in any other company that offers certification or management system consultancy services. 
 
* CIO Strategy Council does not have (and will not form) any relationships with companies who offer consultancy or other services that can be construed as having an impact on the certification services provided by CIO Strategy Council. Any proposed relationship between CIO Strategy Council and any other company will undergo a risk assessment by the Impartiality Committee prior to that relationship being formalized. The risk will be assessed of any current relationships with companies, organizations, and individuals on a regular basis to ensure that the relationship does not impact upon the impartiality of the certification process. 
 
* Individuals employed by or otherwise contracted by CIO Strategy Council for certification and assessment activities are required to disclose their current and past relationships with companies that may be relevant to the certification process. Any situation, past or present, which may present a potential conflict of interest is required by CIO Strategy Council to be declared. CIO Strategy Council will use the information to identify any threats to impartiality and will not use that individual in any capacity unless they can demonstrate that there is no conflict of interest.  
 
* CIO Strategy Council will not allocate a member of staff or subcontractor to a management system audit where any past relationship has existed. At the discretion of the Executive Director, an individual or subcontractor may be allocated to a management system audit where a past relationship has existed under circumstances where there has been no relationship for a minimum of 2 years.  

CIO Strategy Council does not and will not offer any commission or other incentives to any individual or company with respect to referrals of clients unless: 

* The terms and conditions of any such referral are clearly established and can be demonstrated and it can also be demonstrated that the fee is for a referral and the fact that a commission has been paid will in no way affect the outcome of an audit. 
 
* A risk assessment (to establish the potential for an unacceptable threat to impartiality) has been carried out on the process through which any such payment is made to an individual or organisation (normally a consultant) requesting the commission for referrals. 
 
* All such payments are documented, recorded, and traceable and accompanied by a purchase order and invoice. 

* CIO Strategy Council does not offer specific training to any company in respect of implementing a particular standard for that company. Any training offered by CIO Strategy Council is general in nature and available to all companies or individuals who wish to attend.  

* CIO Strategy Council ensures that it is not linked or marketed in any way which links it with the activities of a management system consultancy and will take appropriate action should any such link be identified. 
 
* Auditors and others involved in the certification process are not and will not be put under any pressure and will not be influenced in any way to come to a particular conclusion regarding the result of an audit.

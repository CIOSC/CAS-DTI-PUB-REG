## Overview

Digital Trust and Identity systems are emerging as critical infrastructure and now becoming the crucial underpinning of government and private sector digital services. To address the market need and to ensure confidence in these systems, CIOSC is developing conformity assessment schemes and has applied for accreditation with Standards Council of Canada.

This repository defines the conformity assessment scheme for **Trusted Digital Identities for use by Public Sector and Regulated Programs.** This scheme intended to applied in conjunction with the national standard [**CAN/CIOSC 103-1: Digital Trust and Identity**](https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/find-a-standard/standards-in-digital-trust/digital-trust-fundamentals/) (this link is to the current edition and of the standard a public preview of the next edition of the standard). This standard (and editions thereof) is based on the [**Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.4**](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_4)

### For the purposes of this conformity assessment scheme:
* a **Public Sector Programs** are any public programs or services using a trusted digital identity that is directly provided by a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal government. The services may include, but are not limited to: government sign-in services, online benefits delivery, or licensing and permits. Examples of trusted digital identity services used in this context are the [BC Services Card](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card) and [MyAlberta DigitalID](https://account.alberta.ca/) programs.
* a **Regulated Progams** are any private sector or not-for-profit programs or services using a trusted digital identity that is subject to regulatory requirements such as **Know Your Client (KYC)**, or **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**. These services include the broader public sector, not-for-profit organizations, and for-profit organizations subject to regulatory requiremens. Examples include, but are not limited to: educational institutions, open banking, insurance, health care, hospitals, or any commercially-available service. Examples of trusted digital services used in this context are the [Canada Post IdentityComplete](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/business/postal-services/digital-proof-identity.page) program.


### Scheme Scope and Application:
* The scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be **restricted** to assess a service or program in relation to assessing a the provision of attributes related **trusted digital identity** only,or

* The scope of the conformity assessment scheme and its application may be **broadened** to assesss a service or program in relation to assess the provision of additional attributes, required for the purposes of **eligibility** (beyond the strict defintion of *trusted digital identity*). Examples of additional attributes may include, *citizenship, *residential address*, *health status*, *income level*, *professional qualifications*, etc. 

In all cases, scope and application must be agreed on and documented at the beginning of the assesment enagement.

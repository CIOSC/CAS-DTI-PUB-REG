# Conformity Assessment Scheme: Trusted Digital Identity for use by Public Sector and Regulated Services


## Overview
This repository defines the conformity assessment scheme for **Trusted Digital Identities for use by Public Sector and Regulated Services.** This scheme intended to applied in conjunction with the national standard [**CAN/CIOSC 103-1: Digital Trusted and Identity**](./docs/DOCS.md) (preview of next edition) which is based on the [**Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.4**](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_4)

For the purposes of this conformity assessment scheme:
* a **Public Sector Service** is any service using a trusted digital identity that is directly provided by a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal government. The services may include, but are not limited to: government sign-in services, online benefits delivery, or licensing and permits. Examples of trusted digital identity services used in this context are the [BC Services Card](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card) and [MyAlberta DigitalID](https://account.alberta.ca/) programs.
* a **Regulated Service** is any service using a trusted digital identity that is subject to regulatory requirements such as **Know Your Client (KYC)**, or **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**. These services include the broader public sector, not-for-profit organizations, and for-profit organizations subject to regulatory requiremens. Examples include, but are not limited to: educational institutions, open banking, insurance, health care, hospitals, or any commercially-available service. Examples of trusted digital services used in this context are the [Canada Post IdentityComplete](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/business/postal-services/digital-proof-identity.page) program.

* This scheme **does not confer authority** and is intended to work with **existing legal, policy and governance frameworks**.
* This scheme may be be applied in other contexts (international, domestic, etc.) 
* The scheme has been designed so that **minimal tailoring** is required for different contexts.
